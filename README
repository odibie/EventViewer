TODO James add an index.html file with the bootstrap wireframe we discussed.
     link with libraries in the repo:
     <script src="./lib/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script>
     the bootstrap lib is in a similar location like "lib/bootstrap/dist/js/" and then find the files you need to include.
     Please commit and push when this wireframe file is ready.

TO ALL
   Please work and commit locally until you have important changes that are needed by other team members.
